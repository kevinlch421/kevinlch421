## Hi there

I'm Kevin! 😄  and I am a datascientist who just finished uni at [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk/) 🎓.
I recently used Python to redesign a trading strategy called Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) 📈, check it out [here](https://github.com/kevinlch421/AlgoTrade----Project). When I’m free, I share Python and R projects on GitHub 🖥️ and post funny stuff on Instagram 😜.  Now, I’m looking for data science jobs! 💻
